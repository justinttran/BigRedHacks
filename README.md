<b>Secret Operatives:</b>

A game by Justin Tran, Kevin Li, and Edwin Ma

All backgrounds, character models, and art designs were created from scratch.

To run this game, make sure you have the PyGame library installed for python. 

Then, download and unzip it with 7zip (or whichever program you choose).

Enter to the command prompt and type "cd [path to the unzipped folder]" without quotation marks

Then type "python game.py" (again without quotations).

Arrow keys are used to move, and space bar to shoot.  Type 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the main menu to select a level.  Enjoy!
